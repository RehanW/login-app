# login-app

Hello, please download the repository to your local machine then proceed to the following steps.

Just a note, I have left out authentication for user login ( user can login if a valid email is provided without it matching an existing password ). There is still some validation regarding emails matching and actual email format.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
